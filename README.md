# NASAImages
Fun app to experiment with networking and mapping JSON responses. 

This app connects with the public API provided by NASA and makes use of the "search by keyword" feature. Documentation of the API is found [here](https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf).

## Demonstrates

- MVC architecture
- Lightweight, reusable network layer
- ReST communication with NASA web server
- Mapping of JSON responses to objects using Codable
- Use of Displayable protocol to keep model manipulation out of view controllers
